# hospital-readmission-prediction
End-to-end hospital readmission prediction pipeline using Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit for data analysis, modeling, and deployment.

📘 Overview

This repository presents an end-to-end machine learning project for predicting hospital readmissions using patient demographics, clinical information, and administrative records.
The goal is to build a robust, interpretable model that helps healthcare providers identify high-risk patients, reduce preventable readmissions, and improve overall quality of care and resource management.

🎯 Project Objectives

Identify key factors influencing hospital readmissions.

Build and compare machine learning models to predict readmission risk.

Evaluate performance using clinically relevant metrics.

Interpret model outputs to generate actionable healthcare insights.

Optionally deploy a prediction interface (e.g., Streamlit or Flask app).

🧩 Project Pipeline
1️⃣ Data Collection

Structured EHR or hospital dataset (CSV, SQL, or API source).

Includes patient demographics, diagnoses, procedures, comorbidities, discharge summaries, and length of stay.

2️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, normalization.

Outlier detection and imputation strategies.

Train-test split and cross-validation setup.

3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Distribution of readmission outcomes.

Correlation heatmaps and comorbidity patterns.

Visualization of age, gender, and disease trends using matplotlib and seaborn.

4️⃣ Feature Engineering

Derived variables: previous admissions, Charlson Comorbidity Index, discharge type, and length of stay.

Temporal and categorical feature transformations.

Feature selection using importance ranking or mutual information.

5️⃣ Model Development

Baseline: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree.

Advanced: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, Neural Network.

Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV or Optuna.

Ensemble techniques for better generalization.

6️⃣ Model Evaluation

Metrics: Accuracy, ROC-AUC, F1-score, Precision, Recall, PR-AUC.

Calibration analysis for probability reliability.

Explainability: SHAP and feature importance visualization.

7️⃣ Deployment (Optional)

Streamlit or Flask-based web app for real-time prediction.

Interactive interface for clinicians or administrators to assess readmission risk.

🧠 Technologies Used

Languages: Python (3.10+)

Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, matplotlib, seaborn, SHAP, joblib

Deployment: Streamlit / Flask

Version Control: Git, GitHub
