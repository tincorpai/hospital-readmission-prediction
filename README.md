# hospital-readmission-prediction
End-to-end hospital readmission prediction pipeline using Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit for data analysis, modeling, and deployment.

üìò Overview

Hospital readmissions are a critical challenge for healthcare systems worldwide.
This project presents an end-to-end data science pipeline that predicts the likelihood of patient readmission after discharge, using real-world hospital data.
By combining statistical rigor, machine learning, and model interpretability, it aims to help hospitals identify high-risk patients, reduce preventable readmissions, and enhance quality-of-care initiatives.

üéØ Objectives

Identify the most significant predictors of hospital readmission.

Develop and compare multiple machine learning models for accurate prediction.

Evaluate model performance using clinically meaningful metrics.

Interpret results to generate actionable insights for healthcare decision-makers.

Provide a deployable prototype for real-time readmission risk scoring.

üß© End-to-End Workflow

Data Acquisition: Import structured EHR or hospital discharge datasets (CSV/SQL/API).

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, normalize continuous data, and detect outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize patient demographics, comorbidities, and readmission distributions.

Feature Engineering: Create derived metrics such as length of stay, prior admissions, comorbidity index, and discharge type.

Modeling:

Baseline models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree.

Advanced models: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, Neural Network.

Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV or Optuna.

Model Evaluation: ROC-AUC, F1-score, Precision-Recall, and calibration curves.

Explainability: Feature importance and SHAP analysis to ensure clinical interpretability.

Deployment: Optional Streamlit or Flask web app for real-time risk prediction.
